Concept: To code up a childrens book and have it presented online. A carousel component is used to showcase the images of the 'book' and the idea is to make it 'interactive' by the inclusion of paw prints for buttons. In this way people feel like they are interfacing with Remi as they scroll through the story. 

Key Features: 
Home Page with Remi Paw components for the carousel so you can "read along with remi!", responsive styling for phones included!~
